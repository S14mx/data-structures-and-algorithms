# Array Binary Search

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency

We used a while loop for this task. The time and space complexity for this approach is O(log n).
