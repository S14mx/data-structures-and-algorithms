# Singly Linked List

Implementation of `linked list` data structure

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node  
Create a Linked List class  
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.  
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.  

## Approach & Efficiency

Node based approach

## Methods

`insert`  
Arguments: value  
Returns: nothing  
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.  
`includes`  
Arguments: value  
Returns: Boolean  
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.  
`to string`  
Arguments: none  
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:  
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
