# Trees

Implementation of Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree data structure

## Challenge

Create a Binary Tree class and a Binary Search Tree class

## Approach

Node based approach will be used

## API

### Binary Tree class has the following methods:

* `pre order`

Arguments: none
returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

* `in order`

Arguments: none
returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

* `post order`

Arguments: none
returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

### Binary Search Tree class has the following methods:

* `Add`

Arguments: value
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

* `Contains`

Arguments: value
returns boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
