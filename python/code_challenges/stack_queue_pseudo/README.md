# Challenge Summary

Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

For mimic `enqueue` method time complexity is going to by O(n)(or O(1) if the stack is empty) and space complexity O(1)
For mimic `dequeue` method time and space complexity will be O(1)

## Solution

Note: I worked on the code with Marni Hager and Brian Tarte
